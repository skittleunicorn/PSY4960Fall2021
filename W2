After a ton of trouble shooting, I hope I finally figured this out
I think I was doing everything right, I just didn't know that I needed to add a file so that my branch was not identical to the main branch. Go figure
1. I think I understand how to do a pull request now. And I sort of understand branching. More than before anyway!
2. A lot of things are still unclear to me about using GitHub, especially the organization of it all. I think the way things are organized is probably efficient, I just don't completely get it yet
